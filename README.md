# Credit-Risk-Segmentation-and-Exposure-analysis

## A professional Power BI dashboard to analyze loan applicant data, segment risk, and uncover financial exposure for data-driven decisions in the banking and lending sector.


### It involves:
- Data cleaning and preparation (Excel)
- SQL-based logic to segment borrower risk
- Visual storytelling in Power BI
- 5 clean KPI cards: Income, DTI, Default %, Loan Count, Approval Rate  
- Loan exposure breakdown by Risk Tier  
- Default rates by Loan Purpose & Employment Type  
- A real-time view of who’s defaulting (with filters to drill into risk)

### Key Insights

- **£1.38B** in loans are held by high-risk borrowers — a major exposure point for the business.
- **Unemployed and business-purpose loans** show the highest default rates.
- **Approval rate is high (89.2%)**, but may be overly generous in risk-heavy segments.
- **Loan purpose and employment type** are strong indicators of repayment behavior.
- **Default rate (10.8%)** is under control overall, but concentrated in specific groups.

### Tools Used

- **Excel** – for data cleaning and feature engineering  
- **SQL**– to calculate risk tiers and KPIs  
- **Power BI** – to design visuals, DAX measures, interactivity
